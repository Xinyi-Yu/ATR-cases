# Efficient control synthesis under asynchronous temporal robustness (ATR) constraints
In this paper, we propose a efficient control synthesis method under ATR constraints which are defined with respect to simple safety or  complex signal temporal logic specifications. Paper link will be added later.

#### Instruction

This project corresponds to Section V-B in the paper, which is conducted by Python 3. You can change the parameters in `parameters.py` to obtain different results.

#### Dependencies

We use the following packages

```
gurobipy        9.5.1
matplotlib      3.5.2
numpy           1.22.4
```

#### Acknowledgement

We would like to thank our all the organizations and authors of above packages and also want to thank our colleague Jingshi for the discussion in this work.
